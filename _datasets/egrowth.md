description: The EGrowth database contains 1073 growth curves of 51 species of earthworms, representing 16002 measures of body mass. It covers publications on earthworm body size from 1900 to 2016. The environmental conditions in which the growth curves were produced are also reported (e.g. temperature, pesticides).
