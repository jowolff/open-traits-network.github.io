description: A growing database of plant heat tolerances, primarily for photosynthetic tissues, quantified in terms of temperatures causing a pre-determined level of damage. The present database contains Tcrit and T50 heat tolerance estimates corresponding to the temperatures that cause initial and 50% damage to maximum quantum yield.
taxaList: 123 species names based on the Taxonomic Name Resolution Service
usefulClasses: Heat tolerances of plants growing outdoors in a common garden environment in Miami, FL
dataStandard: "Heat treatment duration: 15 minutes, Recovery time: 24 hours, Damage assessed with maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) fluorescence; standardization of taxonomy mainly based on http://www.theplantlist.org/"
