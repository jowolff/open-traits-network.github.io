Markus Ankenbrand did his PhD in the Molecular Biodiversity Group at the Center for Computational and Theoretical Biology at the University of Würzburg, Germany.

## Bioinformatic Tool Development

My research is focused on extracting knowledge from biological data through bioinformatic methods. As part of that effort I develop workflows, tools and software platforms that help integrate, visualize and analyze biological data. In the field of trait-based ecology I am part of the core development team of <a href='//fennec.molecular.eco'>FENNEC</a>.

## Imaging-derived Phenotypes

My current work at the Comprehensive Heart Failure Center of the University Hospital Würzburg is focused on deriving quantitative phenotypes from imaging data.
