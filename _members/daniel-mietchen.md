I am a biophysicist-turned data scientist based in Jena, Germany, and a volunteer in the Wikimedia ecosystem, i.e. the set of open-knowledge platforms around Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons and especially Wikidata.

## Collaboration statement

Working across the spatial and temporal scales of life is what I enjoy most, with a current emphasis on traits related to biological invasions and other interests related to vocal learning.

I can help with integrating trait-related information and workflows with the Wikimedia ecosystem.

## Projects

[Scholia](https://scholia.toolforge.org/) is a Wikidata-based open-source tool to browse, explore and curate scholarly information. I am part of the core team that develops it.
