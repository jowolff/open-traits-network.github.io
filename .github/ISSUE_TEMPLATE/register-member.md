Rachael is a plant ecologist based in Sydney Australia. 

## Collaboration statement
I enjoy working on applied problems in plant conservation using spatial analyses and traits. My primary (soon to be) open trait dataset is AusTraits - a curated dataset on the traits of Australian plants. This resource was created with harmonisation pipeline created by my collaborator Daniel Falster.

I can offer expertise in workflows for cleaning occurrence data and combining with trait data. I am also happy to help connect people together around traits by running working groups, hosting visitors in my lab, organising symposia at conferences and maintaining our Open Traits website.
